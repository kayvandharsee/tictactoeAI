## Summary
This assignment uses the Minimax algorithm in order to allow the AI to survey all possible outcomes of each move, and play the game optimally.
## Background
This assignment was done for CS50 AI Week 0. There was starter code provided, and so I needed to implement the functions to allow the AI to play optimally. This was done using python.
## Source Code
Due to the CS50 policy, I cannot publically share the source code. Please reach out to me if you would like to see it as long as you are not enrolled in the course.
